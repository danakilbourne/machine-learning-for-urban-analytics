# Objectives {-}

Data Science is more than just a discipline; it's a toolkit for extracting value and insights from diverse datasets. A foundational step in this process is understanding the data at hand. In this module, we start with exploratory data analysis to comprehend the nature of our dataset, gauging potential relationships between variables. 

The realm of data mining has seen exponential growth over the past two decades, introducing a plethora of tools and methodologies. Among them, linear models stand out as both foundational and profoundly powerful. Using housing prices as a case study offers a tangible context given its macro and microeconomics significance. Students benefit from this approach, learning to discern intricate variable interactionsâ€”a skill transferable to many business/application scenarios. Through this module, participants will not only be introduced to (or review) linear models but also delve deep into understanding the essence of what is being modeled. The objective is threefold: to apply the data effectively, to extract meaningful information, and to appreciate the inherent variability intrinsic to statistics.

# Case Study: House Price in Chicago

Real estate decisions, whether for investment or personal use, are often accompanied by numerous questions. How does one determine an appropriate price when buying or listing a property? Does finishing a basement or adding a porch significantly increase the home's value? Regression provides essential answers to such queries. Multiple regression, an evolved form of simple regression, delves into the relationships between one response variable and several predictor variables. This lecture aims to elucidate these regression techniques. **The crux lies in understanding the influence of each predictor on the response, especially in the context of other variables present in the model.** Our methodology seamlessly merges the principles of multiple regression and ANOVA.

Situated as the third-largest metropolitan area in the U.S., Chicago has consistently been a vibrant real estate hub. Yet, its housing market strikes a balance, offering affordability compared to other major American cities. This case study hones in on Chicago house sales data from 2019.

**Study Objective:** How can one accurately determine the value of a property?

- Understand the influence of various features on a property's price.
- With a defined set of features, our goals are to:
    * Ascertain the average house price (confidence intervals).
    * Predict the potential price of a specific property (prediction intervals).
- Delve into the nuances of how a property's location can sway its market value.




**The Dataset:** One of the most captivating facets of our study is the dataset itself.   Hailing from the [Cook County Assessor](https://gitlab.com/groups/ccao-data-science---modeling/-/wikis/SOPs/Open%20Data), where they have compiled and integrated collection of information, meticulously gathered from a variety of distinct sources to offer  an extensive array of individual housing attributes. Beyond the mere physical aspects, this dataset uniquely incorporates social dimensions through spatial information or proximity variables as well as demographic variables by census tract, amongst other fascinating properties. For a comprehensive data breakdown, please refer to `Data_dictionary.html`. The features within are categorized under prefixes such as ACS5 (American community survey data, acs5), Characteristic (char), Location (loc), Meta (meta), Proximity (prox), and Time (time). To ensure an undiluted focus, we will momentarily sidestep the EDA for each variable.  It's imperative to note the nature of specific variables like Type of resident (`char_type_resd`) and neighborhood finish (`char_bsmt_fin`). Recognized as categorical variables, their treatment in analyses diverges, as will be elucidated in the Section's discussion on Categorical Predictors.




# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Before diving deep into formal regression methodologies, it's pivotal to augment our traditional regression analyses with an immersive spatial visualization. Such visual representation offers a more intuitive grasp of the data, revealing patterns and relationships that may not be immediately evident in numerical datasets. While the underlying R code may seem intricate, the emphasis for students should firmly rest on understanding the outcomes and implications these visualizations bring to light. After all, a clear comprehension of the data's story is crucial, even before we begin to craft our regression narratives.


Let's first read in the house sales data in 2019.

```{r}
# install.packages('sf')   # has been done in our first R-chunk
# library(sf)  # done by running p_load(sf)
# browseVignettes('sf') #  details about the package sf

# Single family house sales in 2019
sfh <- read.csv("data/chicago_housing_2019.csv")
# names(sfh)
# View(sfh[1:2,])
dim(sfh)
# str(sfh)
```




## Location, Location, Location: Median House Price Heatmap 

To visualize and analyze spatial data such as the median price by census tract, we need to obtain the spatial data (shapefile or .shp as we learned in the Spatial Data Module) for the census tract. As a refresh, we use `st_read()` to read shapefile in R and then transform the coordinate reference system into the standard `WSG84`.

```{r}
# Chicago shapefile by census tract (map)
tract <- st_read("data/Chicago_CensusTracts2010/CensusTractsTIGER2010.shp") %>% st_transform(crs = 4326)

## The other way to download census tract shapefile is using the tigris package
## It will be super useful for your final project
# library(tigris)
# tracts(state = "IL", county = "Cook County")
```

The census tract data includes the state code (IL), county name (Cook County), tract ID, GEOID, and community area (the loop, river north, Lincoln park, Hyde park, etc.). We center our analysis on census tracts as our unit of observation because of the homogeneous socioeconomic characteristics within each tract. In Chicago, there are approximately 800 such tracts, each serving as a rich source of data for our exploration.  [Here](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/collections/maps/censusinfo.html) is more information on census data for Chicago (e.g., census tract, community areas). 

Let's take a look at the `mapview()` of the community area.

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
mapview(tract, zcol = "COMMAREA")
```

Finally, we plot the median house price by census tract. 
To achieve this, we start by calculating the median house price for each census tract. Once we have these median values, we merge this data with the census tract shapefile on the `census tract GEOID`.

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
## calculate median price by tract
sfh_med <- sfh %>% 
  group_by(loc_census_tract_geoid) %>% 
  summarise(median_price = median(meta_sale_price),
            log_median_price = log(median(meta_sale_price)))
## merge with the shapefile on census tract GEOID
sfh_med <- merge(sfh_med, tract, by.x="loc_census_tract_geoid", by.y = "GEOID10")
## transform data.frame into sf object
sfh_med_sf <- st_as_sf(sfh_med)
## plot using mapview()
# mapview(sfh_med_sf, zcol = "median_price")
mapview(sfh_med_sf, zcol = "log_median_price")
```

As we see, the median house price in Chicago tends to be higher in the northern areas and in neighborhoods closer to the lake. This observation underscores the pivotal role that location plays in the real estate market. It is a vivid reminder that â€˜location, location, locationâ€™ is more than a saying-â€”it is a fundamental principle that significantly influences property values.

## Seasonality

Much like the changing seasons, the real estate market often exhibits its own cyclical patterns. It is well-documented that house sales tend to ebb and flow throughout the months of the year, reflecting a distinct seasonality. Does this rhythmic pattern extend beyond the volume of sales to influence the actual sales price as well?


```{r}
sfh %>% group_by(month = as.factor(time_sale_month_of_year)) %>%
  summarise(volume = n()) %>%
	ggplot(aes(x = month, y  = volume)) + 
	geom_line(group = 1) + 
  theme_bw()
```

The rhythm of real estate is in tune with the calendar. Sales volume typically crescendos from May to July, just before the new school year commences, marking this period as a peak time for families to relocate. Contrastingly, the market tends to cool alongside the weather, reaching its lowest ebb in January and February, the coldest months of the year. However, much like the arrival of spring, the market begins to rebound as the temperatures rise.


```{r}
sfh %>% group_by(month = as.factor(time_sale_month_of_year)) %>%
  summarise(median_price = median(meta_sale_price)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(x = month, y  = median_price)) + 
	geom_line(group = 1, col = 'blue') + 
  theme_bw()
```

When it comes to median sales price, the pattern echoes that of the volume: June and July stand out as months where properties command the highest median prices. These trends underscore the profound connection between the seasonal cycle and the dynamics of the housing market.


## The story of three neighborhoods: Lincoln Park, Hypde Park, Near West Side

To demonstrate our point we will zoom in on three distinct community areas within Chicago, each with its own unique story: Lincoln Park, an affluent neighborhood situated to the north of the Loop (downtown), known for its scenic parks and upscale residences; Hyde Park, a historic area to the south of the Loop, home to the University of Chicago and the early stomping grounds of President Obama; Near West Side, a burgeoning area just west of the Loop, where rapid development is infusing the community with a new and exciting energy. These neighborhoods, each with its own character and charm, serve as prime examples of how location significantly affects the property value.

In the following chucks we select a subset **sales** including the three neighborhoods and a few variables. We also made `log_price`, changed units for some variables. Renamed variables for convenience. 


Most of the remaining analyses will be done with this subset **sales**

(You may jump to the next subsection `A small data set **sales** to get information for this subset. )
 

```{r results=TRUE}
comm <- c("LINCOLN PARK", "HYDE PARK", "NEAR WEST SIDE") #dim(sfh)
sales <- sfh %>% filter(loc_chicago_community_area_name %in% comm) %>%
  mutate(log_price = log(meta_sale_price), # transform the price to log scale
         bldg_1ksf = char_bldg_sf / 1e3, # change the unit of bldg size to 1k sf
         loc_census_tract_geoid = as.character(loc_census_tract_geoid)) %>% 
  select(log_price, bldg_1ksf, char_land_sf:char_type_resd,  char_bsmt_fin, # select a few more variables
         prox_lake_michigan_dist_ft, prox_nearest_cta_stop_dist_ft, other_school_district_secondary_avg_rating,
         loc_census_tract_geoid, loc_chicago_community_area_name, loc_longitude, loc_latitude,
         time_sale_month_of_year) %>%
  tidyr::drop_na()

# names(sales)
dim(sales)   # 506 houses
# str(sales)
# head(sales) 
# View(sales)
```

We rename the variables for convenience.

```{r final chuck sale, results='markup'}
# replace char_, loc_, prox_, other_
sales <- rename_with(sales, ~ gsub("char_", "", .x, fixed = TRUE))
sales <- rename_with(sales, ~ gsub("loc_", "", .x, fixed = TRUE))
sales <- rename_with(sales, ~ gsub("prox_", "", .x, fixed = TRUE))
sales <- rename_with(sales, ~ gsub("other_", "", .x, fixed = TRUE))
# rename chicago_community_area_name with neighborhood
sales <- rename(sales, neighborhood = "chicago_community_area_name")
#names(sales)
```


Let's look at all the houses we included in the data in a map. By leveraging the longitude and latitude coordinates, we can precisely pinpoint the exact location of each house.

```{r eval=knitr::is_html_output()} 
## covert sales df into sf using "longitude", "latitude" as coordinates
sales_sf <- st_as_sf(sales, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

## 'zcol' argument specifies that the 'log_price' column will be used to determine the color
mapview(sales_sf, zcol = "log_price")
```

Finally let us write this small data `sales` out so that one can use it without the data preparation section above.

```{r eval=F}
write.csv( sales, "data/sales.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


## A small data set `sales`

Let first read in a small data set `sales.csv`. 

```{r}
sales <- read.csv("data/sales.csv")
names(sales)
```


Below is a quick description of the features in our dataset (excluding the location information) that we will use for this module.


|Feature|Description|
|--------------|----------------------------------|
|log_price| Log sale price |
|bsmt_fin| finish: 1: Formal Rec Room, 2: Apartment, 3: Unfinished|
|beds|Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the building |
|bldg_1ksf| Building square feet (thousand square feet) |
|fbath|Full Baths: Number of full bathrooms, defined as having a bath or shower. If this value is missing, the default value is set to 1. |
|hbath|Half baths: Number of half baths, defined as bathrooms without a shower or bathtub. |
|land_sf| Lot/land square feet|
|rooms|Rooms: Number of total rooms in the building (excluding baths). Not to be confused with bedrooms. |
|type_resd| Type of resident: 1: 1 Story, 2: 2 Story, 3: 3 Story +, 4: Split Level, 5: 1.5 Story|
|lake_michigan_dist_ft | Distance in feet to the Lake Michigan coastline.|
|nearest_cta_stop_dist_ft| Distance in feet to the nearest CTA (subway) stop. |
|census_tract_geoid| Census tract GEOID by the Census Bureau. |
|neighborhood| Community area. |
|longitude| Longitude of the property. |
|latitude| Latitude of  the property.|
|time_sale_month_of_year| Month of the year of the sales.


Once we know the data structure we will rephrase our goal of study.  Specifically, 

1. Response: $Y$ = `log_price` (base e)
2. Predictors: features of the house and location
3. 
    * Estimate the **mean** `log_price` for all such properties specified below and
    * Predict `log_price` for a particular property described below
4. Are houses in one neighborhood (`neighborhood`) more valuable than others? 
5. In particular, we would like to investigate the `log_price` for this **newly built** property:


|Feature|Value|
|----------|----------------------------------------------|
|bldg_1ksf|3|
|land_sf|5000|
|beds|4|
|rooms|8|
|fbath|4|
|hbath|3|
|basement|Full|
|type|2 Story|
|neighborhood | LINCOLN PARK |
|lake_michigan_dist_ft | 5000 |
|nearest_cta_stop_dist_ft | 2000 |
|time_sale_month_of_year | 7 |
|school_district_secondary_avg_rating | 6 |
|census_tract_geoid | 17031071200 |



We create a new house for prediction as follows.

```{r results=TRUE}
newhouse <- data.frame(meta_sale_price = NA,
                     bldg_1ksf = 3, 
                     land_sf = 5000,
                     beds = 4,
                     rooms = 8,
                     fbath = 4,
                     hbath = 3, 
                     frpl = 2,
                     type = "2 Story",
                     basement = "Full", 
                     neighborhood = "LINCOLN PARK",
                     lake_michigan_dist_ft = 5000,
                     nearest_cta_stop_dist_ft = 2000,
                     time_sale_month_of_year = 7,
                     school_district_secondary_avg_rating = 6,
                     census_tract_geoid = "17031071200"
                     )
newhouse
```
Before we do any analysis take a look at the data:

```{r}
summary(sales)
```

What are the price range in this group? Sizes? Anything you find interesting or 
peculiar? (Pretty expensive neighborhood for sure.)

# Introduction to Multiple Regression 

In this module, we'll unpack the foundation concepts of multiple regression:

* The structure or **Models** we use,
* The method known as **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**,
* And the inherent **Properties of OLS**.

These terms and the following subsections might come off as somewhat theoretical at first glance. To aid clarity, we'll intersperse these discussions with practical examples using the `lm()` function in R. By associating tangible numbers with these abstract ideas, our aim is to enhance comprehension. 

As we progress, keep an eye out for the variable `bldg_1ksf`. It's a prime example of how regression coefficients can vary based on what other variables are in the mix.


## Model Specification

How does `bldg_1ksf` affect `log_price`? 

It depends on how we model the response. We will investigate **three models** with `bldg_1ksf`.

For the ease of presentation, we define some predictors below that we will use in subsequent models:

$$x_1 = bldg\_1ksf, \quad x_2 = land\_sf, \quad x_3 = beds, \quad x_4 = rooms, \quad x_5 = fbath, \quad x_6 = hbath$$

We will create three models:

**M1.** Our first model will only contain one predictor, `bldg_1ksf`:


$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_{i1} + \epsilon$$ 

- **Interpretation of $\beta_1$** is that in general, the mean $y$ will change by $\beta_1$ if a house is 1k square feet larger. So we can't really peel off the effect of the `bldg_1ksf` over $y$. 


**M2.** Next, we add the predictor `land_sf` to our model:
  
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_{i1} + \beta_2 \cdot x_{i2} + \epsilon$$

- **Interpretation of $\beta_1$** is that in general, the mean $y$ will change by $\beta_1$ if a house is 1k square feet larger and the `land_sf`'s are the same. 



**M3.** Finally, we fit a model with multiple predictors:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2} + \beta_3x_{i3} + \beta_4x_{i4} + \beta_5x_{i5} + \beta_6x_{i6} + \epsilon$$

- **Interpretation of $\beta_1$** is that in general, the mean $y$ will change by $\beta_1$ if a house is 1k square feet larger and the rest of the features are the same.  


**Important remarks:**

* **Question 1**: Are all the $\beta_1$'s same in the 3 models above? 

    - **No**. The effect of `bldg_1ksf` $\beta_1$ depends on the rest of the features in the model!!!! 

* **Question 2**: What is the interpretation of $\beta_1$ for the sale price (instead of `y = log_price`)?

    - If a house is 1k square feet larger with the rest of the features being the same, the sale price increases by about $(e^{\beta_1}-1)\times 100$%.



## General multiple linear models

In general, we define a multiple regression as

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \dots + \beta_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_i$$

* Linearity Assumption for this model is 

$$\textbf{E}(y_i | x_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \dots + \beta_p x_{ip} $$

* The homoscedasticity assumption is

$$\textbf{Var}(y_i | x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{ip}) = \sigma^2$$

* The Error term is iid. and defined as

$$\epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$$
This is same to say the errors are independent and with a normal distribution of mean $0$ and an equal variance $\sigma^2$.


* Parameters of interests are all the $\beta's$ and $\sigma^2$.

- Simple interpretations of each $\beta_i's$
- Simple models for predictions



## OLS and its Properties

These $\beta$ parameters are estimated using the same approach as simple regression, specifically by minimizing the sum of squared residuals ($RSS$): 

$$\min_{b_0,\,b_1,\,b_{2},\dots,b_{p}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - b_0 - b_1 x_{i1} - b_2 x_{i2} - \dots - b_p x_{ip})^{2}$$

To be specific, we define let $X$ denote a $n Ã— (p+1)$ matrix whose $(i,j)$th element is $x_{ij}$. That is:

$$X=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 1&  x_{11} & x_{12} & \dots & x_{1p} \\
 1&  x_{21} & x_{22} & \dots & x_{1p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 1&   x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \dots & x_{np} 
 \end{pmatrix}$$ 
 

### OLS Estimates

**Mathematical formula for the OLS estimates:**

The least squared estimators can be obtained precisely by  $$\widehat\beta = (X^{T}X)^{-1} X^{T}Y $$

**Estimate of the mean response given $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p)$:**

$$ \widehat{mean}( y | x_1, x2, \ldots, x_p)= \widehat\beta_0 + \widehat\beta_1 x_{1} + \widehat\beta_2 x_{2} + \dots + \widehat\beta_p x_{p}  $$
**Prediction of $y$ given $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p)$:**

$$ \widehat y | x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p= \widehat\beta_0 + \widehat\beta_1 x_{1} + \widehat\beta_2 x_{2} + \dots + \widehat\beta_p x_{p}  $$
Notice the above two estimates are the same but they have difference interpretations and different variances. 

**Residuals:**

$$\widehat e_i = y_i - \widehat y_i.$$


### Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)
 
For multiple regression, $RSS$ is estimated as:

$$RSS =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \widehat{\epsilon}_i^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-\widehat y_i)^2= \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\widehat\beta_0 + \widehat\beta_1 x_{i1} + \widehat\beta_2 x_{i2} + \dots + \widehat\beta_p x_{ip}))^{2}$$

### Mean Sum of Squares (MSE), Residual Standard Error (RSE)

$\sigma^2$ is estimated by the Mean Sum of Squares (MSE). For multiple regression, MSE is defined as:


$$MSE = \frac{RSS}{n-p-1} \\ 
\text{where }p =\text{number of predictors}$$


$\sigma$ is estimated by the Residual Standard Error (RSE). For multiple regression, RSE is defined as:

$$\widehat \sigma= RSE = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}}$$
**Remark:**

Notice the denominator in $MSE$ is $n-(p+1)$, where $p+1$ is the number of predictors in the model +1. By doing so we have a nice mathematical property: $RSE$ is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$. In another word, in a long run, on average the estimator hits the quantity being estimated. 


### Goodness of Fit: $R^2$

**Total Sum of Squares (TSS)**: 

TSS measures the total variance in the response $Y$. When all the responses are the same which means no predictors affect the response values, then $TSS=0$. In contrast, RSS measures the amount of variability that is left unexplained after performing the regression.

$$TSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^{2}$$


**$R^2$**: 

How much variability is captured in the linear model using this set of predictors? $R^{2}$ measures the proportion of variability in $Y$ that can be explained using this set of predictors in the model. 

$$R^{2} =  \frac{TSS - RSS}{TSS}$$

**Remark 1:**

* $TSS \geq RSS$. Why so???
* $R^2 \leq 1$. 
* $TSS=RSS + \sum (\widehat y_i - \bar y) ^2$.
* $(corr (y, \widehat y))^2$

An $R^{2}$ statistic that is close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the response has been explained by the regression.


**Remark2**:

* How large $R^2$ needs to be so that you are comfortable to use the linear model?
* Though $R^2$ is a very popular notion of goodness of fit, but it has its limitation. Mainly all the sum of squared errors defined so far are termed as `Training Errors`. It really only measures how good a model fits the data that we use to build the model. It may not generate well to unseen data. 


### Properties of the OLS

**Variance of the OLS:**

The variance-covariance matrix of $\widehat \beta$

$$\textbf{V}[\widehat\beta | X] = \sigma^{2} (X^{T}X)^{-1}$$

*Remark:* The above covariance matrix is obtained with a homeostatic variance of $y's$. 

**Normality of the OLS:**

Under all the linear model assumptions, the LSE's are unbiased estimators of $\beta$ and they are normally distributed. 
$$ \widehat\beta | X \sim N(0, \sigma^{2} (X^{T}X)^{-1})$$

**Standard errors**

As soon as we know how to estimate common $\sigma^2$, we can estimate $\textbf{V}[\widehat\beta | X]$ by 
$\widehat {\textbf{V}}[\widehat\beta | X] = \widehat \sigma^{2} (X^{T}X)^{-1}$. The standard error for each $\widehat \beta_i$ will be
$$\text {se}\, (\widehat \beta_i) = \sqrt{( \widehat \sigma^{2} (X^{T}X)^{-1} )}|_{ith\,\text{Diag}}$$

**Confidence intervals each $\beta_i$:**

- a $95\%$ t-interval for $\beta_i$ is 
$$\widehat \beta_i \pm t^*_{.025} \text{se}(\widehat \beta_i).$$
- Here $t^*_{.025}$ is the upper .025 percentile from a $t$ distribution. You may take it to be approximately $1.96$ if we have have a large number of observations $n$. 

- $\text{se}(\widehat \beta_i)$ is taken from the variance formula above.

- It is a t-confidence interval because we need to estimate the unknown $\sigma^2$.

**Hypothesis test for each $\beta_i$:**

To test that 
$$\beta_i = 0  \;\;\; \text{vs.}\;\;\; \beta_i \ne 0$$ 

which means that given other variables in the model, there is no $x_i$ effect. We carry out a t-test:

$$ \text{tstat} = \frac{\widehat \beta_i - 0}{\text{se} (\widehat \beta_i)}$$
The p-value is: 
$$\text{p-value} = 2 \times P(\text{T variable} > |\text{tstat}|).$$

We reject the null hypothesis at an $\alpha$ level if the p-value is < $\alpha$. 

**A $95\%$ Confidence interval for the mean given a set of predictors:**

$$\widehat y \pm \,\,t^*_{.025}\,\, \times se(\widehat y) $$


**A $95\%$ prediction interval for a future $y$ given a set of predictors:**
$$\widehat y \pm \,\,t^*_{.025}\,\, \times \widehat \sigma.$$





## R function `lm()`

Linear models are so popular due to their nice interpretations as well as clean solutions.  R-function `lm()` will be. It takes a model specification together with other options, outputs all the estimators, summary statistics such as varies sum of squares, standard errors of estimators, testing statistics and  p-values.  Finally the predicted values with margin of errors or confidence intervals and prediction intervals can be called.  


## Compare three models

Linear model effects or coefficients are defined within the model, they depend on the rest of the variables in the model.  Let us compare the three model fits, focusing on the interpretations over the coefficients of `bldg_1ksf` in different models. 

### Model 1: `log_price ~ bldg_1ksf`

We first do a simple regression. Let the response $y_i$ be the `log_price` and the explanatory variable $x_{i1}$ be `bldg_1ksf` ($i = 1, \dots, n=180$).


$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_{i1} + \epsilon$$

Model assumptions:

1. Linearity: given `bldg_1ksf`, the mean of `log_price` is described as $\textbf{E}(y_i | x_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$
2. Equal variance: the variances of `log_price` are the same for any `bldg_1ksf` i.e. $\textbf{Var}(y_i | x_{i1}) = \sigma_{1}^2$
3. Normality: `log_price` is independent and normally distributed. i.e. $\epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_{1}^2)$


We now create a model with `lm()`
```{r}
# str(sales)
# summary(sales)
fit1 <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf, data = sales) 
# model specification response ~ x1,.. 
summary(fit1)
# plot(fit1, 1)
ggplot(sales, aes(x = bldg_1ksf , y = log_price)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F) + 
geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(log_price)), color = "red") 
```



Note from the summary below, the $\widehat\beta$ for `bldg_1ksf` is estimated as `r fit1$coefficients[2]`. 
It means on average `log_price` increases `r fit1$coefficients[2]` 
or the price increases $(e^{`r fit1$coefficients[2]`}-1)\times 100 = `r (exp(fit1$coefficients[2])-1)*100`\%$ if a house is 1k square feet larger.

```{r results=TRUE}
# review M1 
fit1 <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf, data = sales)  # model one 
summary(fit1) 
# predict(fit1, newhouse, interval ="prediction",  se.fit = TRUE)  
# TSS <- sum((sales$log_price - mean(sales$log_price))^2)
# RSS <- sum((fit1$res)^2); RSS
# model diagnosese
# plot(fit1$fit, fit1$res); same as plot(fit1, 1) # linearity and homoscedasticity
# qqnorm(fit1$res); qqline(fit1$res) # looking for a well fitted straight line
# plot(fit1, 2)
```


### Model 2: `log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + land_sf`

Let the response $y_i$ be the `log_price` and the explanatory variables be `bldg_1ksf` and `land_sf` ($i = 1, \dots, n=180$).


$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_{i1} + \beta_2 \cdot x_{i2} + \epsilon$$


```{r, results='asis'}
fit2 <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + land_sf, data = sales) 
stargazer::stargazer(fit1, fit2, type=output_format, align=TRUE)
```


**Quick notes:**

1. The order of predictors plays no role.
2. The output of `lm()` is similar regardless how many predictors are used.
3. The model assumptions extended automatically here. 

```{r echo=F}
# summary(fit2)  #sum((fit2$res)^2)
```



Let us compare `fit2: bldg_1ksf + land_sf` to `fit1: bldg_1ksf` 

1. The coefficient for `bldg_1ksf` changed to `r fit1$coef[2]` from `r fit2$coef[2]`!!!!
2. $R^{2}$ is `r summary(fit2)$r.sq` from `summary(fit1)$r.sq` - quite an increase. (Never decreasing, why?)
3. $RSE$ (Residual standard error) is now `r summary(fit2)$sigma` decreased from `r summary(fit1)$sigma` (almost never decreasing, why?)


The effects of variables ($\beta's$) are defined within the model. They all depend on what else are included or accounted for in the model!


### Model 3:  Several continuous variables

We now add multiple variables to our model:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2} + \beta_3x_{i3} + \beta_4x_{i4} + \beta_5x_{i5} + \beta_6x_{i6} + \epsilon$$


```{r results=TRUE}
str(sales)
fit3 <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + land_sf + beds + rooms +
           fbath + hbath, data = sales)
summary(fit3)  
# names(fit3)
# fit3$fit
# fit3$res
# # shift+c+command: to comment the portion selected 
# confint(fit3)
# 2*pnorm(2.84, lower.tail = FALSE) # pvalues
# newhouse
# predict(fit3, newhouse)
# predict(fit3, sales[3, ]) 
# RSS <- sum((fit3$residual)^2)
# MSE <- RSS/219  #df n-(p+1)=226-(6+1)
# RSE <- sqrt(MSE)
# TSS <- sum((sales$log_price - mean(sales$log_price))^2)   # (226-1)*var(sales$log_price)
# RSquare <- (TSS-RSS)/TSS
# RSquare < (cor(sales$log_price, fit3$fit))^2 # correlation between y and y-hat
```


Based on the output from model 3:

 $\widehat\beta_{bldg\_1ksf}$ = `r coef(fit3)[2]` for model 3. Is this estimate wrong?



To summarize, the effects of `bldg_1ksf` from the above three models are

```{r include=F}
data.frame(Model.1 = coef(fit1)[2], 
           Model.2 = coef(fit2)[2], 
           Model.3 = coef(fit3)[2])
```


```{r results='asis'}
# process the lm output into a table
stargazer(fit1, fit2, fit3, type = output_format, 
                     # ci=TRUE, ci.level = .95,
                     keep.stat = c("n", "rsq", "sigma2", "ser"))
```

**Note:**

* They are different as expected
* Each one has its own meaning!



## Inference for a fixed model


Given a fixed model with several predictors, say model 3, assume all the linear model assumptions are met. Let us walk through the possible outcomes and point out the limitations. 


**Fit the model:**


```{r results=TRUE}
fit3 <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + land_sf + beds + rooms +
           fbath + hbath, data = sales)
summary(fit3) ### key output
# summary(lm(log_price ~ rooms, sales))
# mean(sales$log_price)  13.7
# shift+c+command: to comment the portion selected 
names(fit3)
# fit3$fit
# predict(fit3, sales)
# predict(fit3, sales[1, ])
# fit3$res
# confint(fit3)
# 2*pnorm(6.21, lower.tail = FALSE) # pvalues
# newhouse
# predict(fit3, newhouse)
# RSS <- sum((fit3$residual)^2)
# MSE <- RSS/499   #df=n-(p+1)=506-(6+1)=499  \sig^2
# RSE <- sqrt(MSE)
# TSS <- sum((sales$log_price- mean(sales$log_price))^2)
# RSquare <- (TSS-RSS)/TSS
# RSquare <- (cor(sales$log_price, fit3$fit))^2
```

```{r results=TRUE}
## clean summary table and arrange it by tstat
fit3.summary <- data.frame(summary(fit3) %>% coefficients) %>%
  rename(estimate = Estimate,
         se = "Std..Error",
         tstat = "t.value",
         pvalue = "Pr...t..") %>%
  mutate(abs.tstat = abs(tstat)) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs.tstat))

knitr::kable(fit3.summary)
```


**Questions of interests:**

From the Model 3:

1. Write down the final OLS equation of `log_price` based on the features.

2. Interpret each coefficient in the model.

3. What is the standard error from the output? Precisely what does it measure?

4. What does each t-interval (z)  and t-test (z) do?

5. Is `fbath` **THE** most important variable, `bldg_iksf` the second, etc since they each has the smallest p-value,...

6. What does `rse` do?

7. If we had changed the `land_sf` to `land_1ksf` what would be the coefficient? 

7. Interpret the $R^2$ reported for this model. Do you feel comfortable using the current output based on this reasonably large $R^2$

8. Is `bldg_1ksf` most useful variable due to its largest coefficient in magnitude? (Statistical significance vs. practical significance)

9. Can you conclude that with $95\%$ confidence all the $t$-confidence intervals provided above are right simultaneously?

10. Can we conclude that `rooms` is no longer needed?

11. If we refit the data without `rooms`, would all the p-values be small? 

12. Can we conclude that none of `beds`, `rooms` and `hbath` is needed?

13. What does the F test with a small p-value do? 


## Confidence Interval for the Mean

Base on Model 3, the mean of `log_price` among all houses with the same features as the newly built house: `bldg_1ksf` = 3, `land_sf` = 5000, `beds` = 4, `rooms` = 8, `fbath` = 4, `hbath` = 3, `frpl` = 2, `bsmt_fin` = 1, `neighborhood` = "Full", `gar1_size` = 3 is

$$\widehat{y} = 12.59 + 3 \times .187 + 5000 \times .00013 - 4 \times .083 + 8 \times .0169 + 4 \times .17 + 3 \times .113 = 14.6, $$
with a $\text{standard error}$ for the regression line $.104$.

We will get the prediction, standard error and the confident intervals by `predict()`.

```{r results=TRUE}
predict(fit3, newhouse, interval = "confidence", se.fit = TRUE) 
```

**Question:** What assumptions are needed to make this a valid confidence interval?

Now turn the mean log price back to the dollars we get the average for such a house vary from $ exp(14.4) = 1794075$ to $ exp(14.8) = 2676445$. 

## Prediction Interval 

Base on Model 3, `log_price` for this particular new house is

$$\widehat{y} = 12.59 + 3 \times .187 + 5000 \times .00013 - 4 \times .083 + 8 \times .0169 + 4 \times .17 + 3 \times .113 = 14.6, $$
with a 95% prediction interval approximately to be 

$$\widehat{y} \pm 2\times RSE = 14.6 \pm 2 \times .467.$$

The prediction interval can be obtained by `predict()`.

```{r results=TRUE}
predict(fit3, newhouse,  interval = "predict", se.fit = TRUE) # future prediction intervals
```

Q: What assumptions are needed to make this a valid prediction interval?

Now turn the predicted log price for this house back to the dollars. It varies from  $ exp(13.7) = 89.911$ to $ exp(15.6) = 5956538$. 


## Model Diagnoses

To check the model assumptions are met, we examine the residual plot and the qqplot of the residuals.

We use the first and second plots of `plot(fit)`.

```{r eval=T}
par(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(5,2,4,2), mgp=c(3,0.5,0)) # plot(fit3) produces several plots
plot(fit3, 1, pch=16) # residual plot
abline(h=0, col="blue", lwd=2)
plot(fit3, 2) # qqplot
summary(fit3)
```

Are the linear model assumptions met for the model fit here (`fit3`)? What might be violated? 

- Linearity?
- Equal variances (homoscedasticity)?
- Normality?

Roughly speaking, the linearity, homoscedasticity and normality assumptions are satisfied. (Very subjective!)

# F-test

With multiple variables, we need to test whether a set of $\beta$'s being 0. 
For example, we want to ask whether $\beta_\text{rooms}$, $\beta_\text{beds}$ and $\beta_\text{hbath}$ are not useful.

Mathematically, we test the null hypothesis

$$H_0: \beta_\text{rooms}=\beta_\text{beds}=\beta_\text{hbath} = 0 \mbox{ vs. } H_1: \text{at least one of } \beta_\text{rooms},\beta_\text{beds}, \beta_\text{hbath} \text{ is non-zero}$$
    
To put it in another way, $H_0$ is the **reduced model:**

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text {bldg\_1ksf}} x_{\text{i,bldg\_1ksf}} + \beta_{\text{land\_sf}} \,\, x_{\text{i,land\_sf}}  + \beta_{\text{fbath}}x_{\text{i,fbath}} +  + \epsilon_i$$

and $H_1$ is the **full model:**

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{bldg\_1ksf}} x_{\text{i,bldg\_1ksf}} +
  \beta_{\text{beds}}x_{\text{i, beds}}  \\
+ \beta_{\text{land\_sf}} x_{\text{i,land\_sf}} +
\beta_{\text{rooms}}x_{\text{i, rooms}} + \beta_{\text{fbath}}x_{\text{i,fbath}} +  \beta_{\text{hbath}}x_{\text{i, hbath}} + \epsilon_i$$


**Theorem**: Assume the linear model assumptions hold, then under the $H_0$

$$F_{\text{stat}}:=\frac{\frac{RSS(H_0)-RSS(H_1)}{df_1}}{\frac{RSS(H_1)}{df_2}} \sim F_{df_1, df_2}$$
where 
$$\begin{split} 
{df}_1 &= \text{\# of parameters in } H_1 - \text{\# of parameters in } H_0 \\
{df}_2 &= \text{\# of observations} - \text{\# of parameters in } H_1
\end{split}.$$

The p-value is

$$\text{p-value}=P(F_{{df}_1, {df}_2} > F_{\text{stat}})$$

To explore, we can run a model without `beds` and `bldg_1ksf`.
```{r F test, results='hold'}
fit3.0 <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + land_sf  + fbath, data = sales) # under H0
summary(fit3.0)
sum((summary(fit3.0)$residuals)^2) # RSS(H_0)

fit3 <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + land_sf + beds + rooms +
           fbath + hbath, data = sales)
summary(fit3)
sum((summary(fit3)$residuals)^2) # RSS(H_1)  # dim(sales)
```

$$F_{\text{stat}}=\frac{\frac{RSS(H_0)-RSS(H_1)}{df_1}}{\frac{RSS(H_1)}{df_2}} = \frac{\frac{115 - 109}{3}}{\frac{109}{506-4}}=6.49$$

Based on the $F$-test given above, the $p$-value is 
$$P(F_{3,502} > 6.49) = .000258$$

```{r results=TRUE}
pf(6.49, 3, 499, lower.tail=F)  
# hist(rf(10000, 3, 499), breaks=40)    # take a look at the F disn 
```

We reject $H-0$ and conclude that we can not drop three variables at the same time. 



## `anova()`

We can use the `anava()` function to carry out the above F-test `anova(H_0, H_1)`.

```{r results=TRUE}
anova(fit3.0, fit3)
```

**Conclusion:** The p-value being so small gives us evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

## F-test for full model

**Questions** based on the summary for `fit3`:

1) What is the $F$-statistics from `summary(fit3)`? What would be the null hypothesis? 

2) Can you perform a $F$-test for each $\beta$ being 0? What is the relationship between the F-test and the t-test?


**Answer to 1) **:

$F$-statistics from `summary(fit3)` is to test whether all the variables as a whole is useful, i.e., the null hypothesis is

$$H_0: \beta_{\text{bldg\_1ksf}} =
  \beta_{\text{beds}} = \beta_{\text{land\_sf}} =
\beta_{\text{rooms}} = \beta_{\text{fbath}} = \beta_{\text{hbath}} = 0,$$

and the alternative hypothesis is at least one of the $\beta$'s are not zero.

```{r R^2 and F, results=TRUE}
TSS <- sum((sales$log_price - mean(sales$log_price))^2)
TSS

fit.null <- lm(log_price ~ 1, sales)
TSS <- sum((summary(fit.null)$residuals)^2) 

RSS <- sum((summary(fit3)$residuals)^2) 

anova(fit.null, fit3)
summary(fit3)$fstatistic
```

**Answer to 2)**:

We can perform F-test with the full model and models with one less variable one by one. For example, 
$$H_0: \beta_{\text{beds}} = 0 \quad \mbox{vs} \quad H_1: \beta_{\text{beds}} \neq 0, $$
which becomes a $t$-test.

We can use `anova()` to perform this $F$-test with a single variable.

```{r, results=TRUE}
fit_no_rooms <- lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + land_sf + rooms + hbath + fbath, sales)
anova(fit_no_rooms, fit3)
```

Let's compare with the $t$-test.

```{r, results=TRUE}
summary(fit3)
```

The p-values are the same. 

\pagebreak

# Categorical Predictors: `neighborhood`

Let's focus on location. We pick three neighborhoods, Lincoln Park (LP), Hyde Park (HP), and Near West Side (NWS), in our dataset and explore the following questions:

1. Are houses in Lincoln Park more valuable than others?
2. How does `neighborhood` affect the price?

Model with a categorical variable is termed as a "One Way ANOVA"

First, we get the sample means and sample standard error for each group, and plot each
```{r results=TRUE}
sales %>%
group_by(neighborhood) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(log_price),
    sd  = sd(log_price),
    n = n()
  )
  
ggplot(sales) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = neighborhood, y = log_price))
```


We use indicator predictors to analyze the effect of `neighborhood`.


## Model 0 - A/B testing

In STAT101, we always start to compare two sample means. We may ask "Are houses in LP more expensive than HP?" We may also ask "Are houses in NWS less expensive than those in HP?"... These questions can be answered by hypothesis testing. 

Let us start with model assumptions: 

$$y_{i|x=HP} = \mu_{HP} + \epsilon_i$$
$$y_{i|x=LP} = \mu_{LP} + \epsilon_i$$
$$y_{i|x=NWS} = \mu_{NWS} + \epsilon_i$$
where $\mu_{HP}$, $\mu_{LP}$ and $\mu_{NWS}$ are the mean log price in each neighborhood and $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. 

"Are houses in LP more expensive than those in HP?" We will set up the hypothesis as follows:

$$H_0: \mu_{LP} = \mu_{HP} \quad \mbox{v.s.} \quad H_A: \mu_{LP} \neq \mu_{HP}.$$
We will use a t-test:

$$t=\frac{{\bar Y}_{Full}- \bar Y_{Apt}}{SE (\bar Y_{Full}- \bar Y_{Apt})}= \frac{14 - 13.4}{(\widehat \sigma = .51) \sqrt{1/324+1/62}}= 8.49$$
where $\widehat \sigma$ is the so-called "two-sample pooled standard error of the common $\sigma$":

$$ \widehat \sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{ (324-1) \times .51^2 + (62-1) \times .488^2}{324+62-2}} = .51$$
The p-value is $2* P( t > 8.49) < 0.01$. We will reject the null hypothesis at 0.01 level and conclude that on average the log sale price of houses with full basement is different from those without. More over, since the sample mean of the log price of full basement houses is higher, we can conclude that the log sale price of houses with full basement is higher than those without.

The above test results can be obtained through `lm()`. **You must be curious how we can run lm() with a categorical predictor?**
We turn a categorical variable into a continuous variable through indicator functions/dummy variables.

```{r results=T}
sales_sub <-  sales %>% filter(neighborhood == "HYDE PARK" | neighborhood == "LINCOLN PARK")
sales_sub$neighborhood <- factor(sales_sub$neighborhood)
levels(sales_sub$neighborhood)

fit.AB <- lm(log_price ~ neighborhood, sales_sub) 
# model.matrix(fit.AB) will take the model matrix X in regression fit.AB
cbind(sales_sub$neighborhood, as.data.frame(model.matrix(fit.AB)))[c(1,2,326),]
summary(fit.AB)
```

Similarly, we can test whether houses in NWS are less expensive than those in HP on average and other comparisons... 

A two-sample means or two-sample proportions comparison is also called A/B testing. They are used often now for online quick assessments/testing to study whether Advertisement method 1 is better than Advertisement method 2; whether one web layout is more attractive to customers than another layout etc.

In one way ANOVA, we use the indicator functions to handle categorical variables as well. 


## Model 1 - One Way ANOVA

$$y_{i|x=HP} = \mu_{HP} + \epsilon_i$$
$$y_{i|x=LP} = \mu_{LP} + \epsilon_i$$
$$y_{i|x=NWS} = \mu_{NWS} + \epsilon_i$$
where $\mu_{HP}$, $\mu_{LP}$ and $\mu_{NWS}$ are the mean MPG of each continent and $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. We want to compare the three means and this can be done through linear model with indicator functions.

We are interested in the following hypotheses:

$$H_0: \mu_{HP} = \mu_{LP} = \mu_{NWS}$$


Let 

* `HP` as the base 

* $x_1$ be the indicator function of being `LP`, i.e. $I\{neighborhood = LP\}$

* $x_2$ be the indicator function of being `NWS` $I\{neighborhood = NWS\}$

Then the above Anova model is same as

$$\begin{split}  y_i &= \beta_{HP} + \beta_{LP} x_{1,i} + \beta_{NWS} x_{2,i} + \epsilon_i \\ &= \beta_{HP} + \beta_{LP} I\{neighborhood = LP\} + \beta_{NWS} I\{neighborhood = NWS\} + \epsilon_i \end{split} $$
where

* $\beta_{HP} = \textbf{E}(Price|HP)$

* $\beta_{LP} = \textbf{E}(Price|LP)-\textbf{E}(Price|HP)$: the increment between Lincoln Park and Hyde Park

* $\beta_{NWS} = \textbf{E}(Price|NWS)-\textbf{E}(Price|HP)$: the increment between North West Side and Hyde Park


To test $$H_0: \mu_{HP} = \mu_{LP} = \mu_{NWS}$$ is same as to test
$$H_0: \beta_{LP} = \beta_{NWS} = 0$$


Now we can use `lm()` to fit the model and house out the tests

```{r results=TRUE}
fit.neighborhood <- lm(log_price ~ neighborhood, sales)
summary(fit.neighborhood)  
```

The $F$-stat here is to test $H_0: \; \beta_{LP} = \beta_{NWS} = 0$, i.e., there is no difference among the three neighborhood.  We reject $H_0$ at $\alpha=0.01$, and conclude the mean `log_price`'s are different among the three neighborhood.  This can be also achieved using `Anova()` from the car package!



```{r, results=T}
Anova(fit.neighborhood)
```

### Changing the base category

We use `HP` as the base category in the `neighborhood` variable. Therefore, each coefficient captures the effect of the level vs. `HP`.

```{r, results=T}
levels(sales$neighborhood)
model.matrix(fit.neighborhood)[5:20, ]
```

Remarks: `fit.neighborhood` can also be obtained from

```{r}
fit.neighborhood.1 <- lm(log_price ~ I(neighborhood == "LINCOLN PARK") + I(neighborhood == "NEAR WEST SIDE") , sales)
summary(fit.neighborhood.1)    
model.matrix(fit.neighborhood.1)[5:10, ]
```

We also show a model without intercept $\beta_0$. Can you interpret the summary table below? 
```{r results=TRUE}
fit.neighborhood.2 <- lm(log_price ~ 0 + neighborhood , sales) #
summary(fit.neighborhood.2)  
model.matrix(fit.neighborhood.2)[5:10, ] # try to show you the indicator variables created
```

Questions from the above fit:

- What does each $t$-test do?
- What does $R^2$ mean?
- What does the $F$-test do here? 


**`constrast()`**

To estimate the mean difference between two regions, we can use the `contrast()` function from package `contrast`.

```{r  results=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
contrast(fit.neighborhood, list(neighborhood = "LINCOLN PARK"), list(neighborhood = "HYDE PARK"))
contrast(fit.neighborhood, list(neighborhood = "LINCOLN PARK"), list(neighborhood = "NEAR WEST SIDE"))
```

**Changing base level**

We can choose the base level as we want. We demonstrate this by setting up houses without neighborhood as the base category:

```{r results=TRUE}
sales_neighborhood <- sales
sales_neighborhood$neighborhood <- factor(sales_neighborhood$neighborhood, 
                                          levels = c("NEAR WEST SIDE", "HYDE PARK", "LINCOLN PARK"))  
summary(lm(log_price ~ neighborhood, sales_neighborhood))
```

Note that:

1. The $F$-stat should be the same. 
2. The coefficients are different but the mean estimates are the same.


**Drawback of one way Anova:** other factors should be also taken into consideration.


## Model 2 - Model without Interaction

Let us take one important variable `land_sf` in addition to the `neighborhood`. We might automatically use our additive model as follows:


$$\text{Log\_price} = \beta_{HP} + \beta_{LP} \cdot I(neighborhood = LP) + \beta_{NWS} \cdot I(neighborhood = NWS) + \beta_1 \cdot land\_sf + \epsilon$$

<!-- We first show three scatter plots by region with `lm` line added. Though the slopes seem to be little different for the sake of simple interpretation we  will fit a usual additive model without interaction, that is, we assume the effect of `land_sf` over `log_price` are the same.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ggplot(sales, aes(x = land_sf, y = log_price, color=neighborhood)) +  -->
<!--   geom_point() +  -->
<!--   geom_smooth(method = "lm" , se =F) +  -->
<!--   facet_wrap(~ neighborhood) +  -->
<!--   labs(title="Log sales price by lot size") -->
<!-- # ggplot(sales, aes(x = land_sf, y = log_price, color = neighborhood)) + -->
<!-- #   geom_point() + -->
<!-- #   geom_smooth(method = "lm" , se =F) + -->
<!-- #   labs(title = "Model With Interactions") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Let's fit and plot the least squared estimates as functions of `land_sf` and `neighborhood`:
```{r}
fit.no.interation <- lm(log_price ~ neighborhood+land_sf, sales)
coefs <- (summary(fit.no.interation))$coefficients[, 1]

ggplot(sales, aes(x = land_sf, y = log_price, color = neighborhood)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(intercept =coefs[1], slope=coefs[4], color ="#F8766D") + 
  geom_abline(intercept =coefs[1]+coefs[2], slope=coefs[4], color = "#00BA38") +
  geom_abline(intercept =coefs[1]+coefs[3], slope=coefs[4], color ="#619CFF") +
  labs(title = "Model Without Interactions")
```


This model is termed a model without interaction. Here we assume that the effect of `land_sf` on `Log_price` is the same controlling for each `neighborhood`. 


```{r results=TRUE}
fit.no.interation <- lm(log_price ~ land_sf + neighborhood, sales)
summary(fit.no.interation)   # Anova(fit.no.interation)
```

To test whether `neighborhood` is significant after controlling for `land_sf`, we can use `anova(H_0, H_1)`.

```{r results=TRUE}
anova(lm(log_price ~ land_sf, sales), fit.no.interation)  
#anova( fit.no.interation, lm(log_price ~ land_sf, sales)  )  
```

p-value < 0.01, a strong evidence of rejecting the null hypothesis that there is a `neighborhood` effect.


### `Anova()`

We can also use `Anova()` from the `car` package.

```{r results=TRUE}
Anova(fit.no.interation) 
```

We reject $H_0$ at $\alpha=0.01$, i.e., controlling `land_sf`, we have the strong evidence that the effect of `neighborhood` is different.


**Remark:** Models without interactions are simple and we can test neighborhood effects directly. But we may ask ourselves is this assumption reasonable?

```{r}
predict(fit.no.interation, newhouse)
predict(fit.no.interation, newhouse, interval = "predict", se.fit = TRUE)
predict(fit.no.interation, newhouse, interval = "confidence", se.fit = TRUE)
```

## Model 3 - Model with Interaction

It is possible that  `land_sf` effects depend on  `neighborhood`.

```{r eval=T}
ggplot(sales, aes(x = land_sf, y = log_price, color = neighborhood)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm" , se =F, HPrange=TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "Model With Interactions")
```

As we can see from the plot, houses in Lincoln Park and Hypde Park is more expensive if `land_sf` is larger; while prices in near west side do not vary much with `land_sf`. 
In addition, the slope for Lincoln Park is steeper than that for Hypde Park, meaning the same unit increase in `land_sf` yields higher price increase for Lincoln Park. To capture the difference in `land_sf` between the three neighborhoods, we introduce models with interactions `log_price` ~ `land_sf` by `neighborhood`. 

$$y_{i|HP,\, land\_sf} = \beta_{HP} + \beta_{1_{HP}} \cdot land\_sf + \epsilon_i$$
$$y_{i|LP,\, land\_sf} = \beta_{LP} + \beta_{1_{LP}} \cdot land\_sf + \epsilon_i$$

$$y_{i|NWS,\, land\_sf} = \beta_{NWS} + \beta_{1_{NWS}} \cdot land\_sf + \epsilon_i$$

This can be done through the following indicators:


$$Y = \beta_{HP} + \beta_{LP} \cdot I(neighborhood = LP) + \beta_{NWS} \cdot I(neighborhood = NWS) + \\
 \beta_{1_{HP}} \cdot land\_sf + \beta_{1_{LP}} \cdot land\_sf \cdot I(neighborhood = LP) + \beta_{1_{NWS}} \cdot land\_sf \cdot I(neighborhood = NWS) + \epsilon$$


Similarly, 

* $\beta_{LP}$ is the increment of intercept between Lincoln Park and Hyde Park, ... 

* $\beta_{1_{LP}}$ is the increment of slope between Lincoln Park and Hyde Park, ...

Use `lm()` with interaction: 

```{r results=TRUE}
fit.with.interaction <- lm(log_price ~ land_sf_1k * neighborhood, sales %>% mutate(land_sf_1k = land_sf/1e3))
summary(fit.with.interaction)    #model.matrix(fit.with.interaction)[1:3,]
#summary(lm(log_price ~ land_sf + neighborhood + land_sf*neighborhood, sales)) # this is same as fit.with.interaction
```

**Question:** Is the interaction effect significant? Are the effects of `land_sf` the same across `neighborhood`? 

To test there is no interaction is same as to test
$$H_0: \beta_{1_{LP}} = \beta_{1_{NWS}} = 0$$
which we can do with `anova()`
```{r results=TRUE}
anova(fit.no.interation, fit.with.interaction)
Anova(fit.with.interaction)
```


We reject the null hypothesis at 0.001 level, which indicates there is an interaction effect between `land_sf` and neighborhood.

# A more flexible model

> **"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."** --- Box, George E. P.; Norman R. Draper (1987). Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces, p. 424, Wiley. ISBN 0471810339.

All model is wrong because it is an abstraction or simplification of reality. 
``The practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.''
If a model helps us explain, predict, and understand the universe better, it is useful.

We have plotted a lot of maps in our class, and maps are also a type of model! 
They are wrong compared to the real world, but good maps are useful for navigation, planning, and understanding the world.

Model diagnoses can help to ensure that the model assumptions are met. In addition, domain knowledge is quite important in guiding model building and hence we need to talk to domain experts. Let's now try a model which includes all sensible variables.

Note that `bsmt_fin` is a categorical variable with three levels and `type_resd` is a categorical variable with five levels. We will first convert `bsmt_fin` into `basement` and `type_resd` into a categorical variable.

```{r results=TRUE}
#str(sales)
sales$basement <- factor(sales$bsmt_fin, levels = 1:3, labels = c("Full", "Apt", "None"))
levels(sales$basement)
```

```{r}
sales$type <- factor(sales$type_resd, 
                     levels = 1:5,
                     labels = c("1 Story", "2 Story", "3 Story +", "Split Level", "1.5 Story"))
levels(sales$type)  
```

The census tract ID `census_tract_geoid` should be also a categorical variable.

```{r}
sales$census_tract_geoid <- as.factor(sales$census_tract_geoid)
```


```{r results=TRUE}
data2 <- sales %>% select(-bsmt_fin, -type_resd, -longitude, -latitude, -census_tract_geoid)
names(data2)
```

**QUESTION**: What would have happened if you have added `census_tract_geoid` into the model???

```{r results=TRUE}
fit.all <- lm(log_price ~. , data2)    #convenient way to include all variables
summary(fit.all)

# fit.all.tract <- lm(log_price ~., sales %>% select(-bsmt_fin, -type_resd, -longitude, -latitude) 
# Anova(fit.all.tract)  # notice there is no df for neighborhood and why?

```

The $t$-table is pretty messy, many variables are not significant, need to do `Anova()`

```{r results=TRUE}
Anova(fit.all)
```



Comments:

1. `neighborhood` is still significant after accounting for all other variables.
2. Can we drop all the variables with $p$-values larger than $.05$?
3. We don't have to use a model with all $p$-value being small!



**Model diagnosis**: check if three assumptions of linear models are met.

Residuals vs Fitted and qqnormal Plot, both plots look fine.
```{r  eval = T}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(fit.all, 1) 
plot(fit.all, 2) 
```



We now provide confidence Interval for the mean of houses like our `newhouse`
```{r results=TRUE}
fit.mean.new <- predict(fit.all, newhouse, interval = "confidence") 
fit.mean.new
```


We also provide prediction interval on this `newhouse`
```{r results=TRUE}
fit.new <- predict(fit.all, newhouse, interval = "prediction", se.fit=TRUE)
fit.new$fit
fit.new$se.fit
fit.new$residual.scale
```

# What about causality?

> Association is not causality.

Association is a statistical concept and the model assumptions in our linear model are statistical as well. Causality by itself is a philosophical concept and statistics, such as linear models, is a tool to estimate causal effects. In order to make a causal statement, we need to impose **causal assumptions**. **Causal inference** in statistics is the topic to study how to make causal statements from data, including under which circumstances correlation (association) does imply causation.

One way to impose causal assumptions to through the structural causal graph (Pearl, 2009). The causal graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the nodes are variables and the edges are causal relationships. 

Let's say we want to identify the causal effect of treatment or policy $D$ on outcome $Y$, e.g., the causal effect of `bldg_1ksf` on `log_price`. In addition to, we observe other variables $X$. The causal graph is as follows:

```{r out.width="100%"}
url <- "https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/_images/graphviz-8852e5db087f49410d0a5212d9b7fdcb58f0aaf9.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

The causal question is how much `log_price` would have increased if the house had been 1000 square feet larger?

Now you might have two questions in mind: 

1. We only observe the current house but not the smaller or the larger one;
2. There are many other factors, such as some in $X$, that will affect both $D$ and $Y$.

The first question is about the **counterfactual** and the second question is about **confounding**.

## Potential outcomes framework: Counterfacutals

The counterfactual is the outcome of a unit under a treatment that was not actually received by the unit. The other name for it is "potential outcomes". The counterfactual is not observable. 

Let's use a binary treatment for example. Each unit has two potential outcomes. One without treatment ($Y_{0i}$) and one with treatment ($Y_{1i}$). The causal effect is $Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$. However, we will ever only observe one outcome ($Y_i$): if the one is treated, $Y_i = Y_{1i}$; if not treated $Y_i = Y_{0i}$. This is the fundamental challenge of causal inference, or the identification issue in econometrics. 

To solve this problem, we can think of it as a prediction problem. If we observe the treated, we can predict the untreated outcome and vice versa. Intuitively, to correctly predict the counterfactual, we want to compare similar units. 

Suppose we have many units. We could compare the average observed outcomes or conditional expectation: 
$$\mathbb{E}[Y_i | D_i = 1] -  \mathbb{E}[Y_i | D_i = 0].$$
When would the above be a good estimate of the causal effect?

The above expression can be rewritten as
$$\mathbb{E}[Y_{1i}|D_i = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 1] + \mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 0].$$

Note that $\mathbb{E}[Y_i |D_i = 1] = \mathbb{E}[Y_{1i} |D_i = 1]$ because the mean of the observed outcome for the treated is the same as the mean potential outcome for the treated when treated. In the same way, $\mathbb{E}[Y_i|D_i = 0] = \mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 0]$.

* The first term $\mathbb{E}[Y_{1i}|D_i = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 1] = \mathbb{E}[Y_i | D_i = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 1]$ is the average treatment effect for the treated (ATT): the observed outcome for the treated minus what would have happened if the treated had not been treated.
* The second term $\mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{0i}|D_i = 0]$ is the so-called selection bias. It is a baseline difference and we want it to be zero so that the outcome for the treated when they are not treated (counterfactual) is the same as the observed outcome for the control units when they are not treated. Then a simple comparison of average outcomes can provide an estimate of average treatment effects. Then the control group observed outcomes can provide an unbiased estimate of the counterfactual for the treated. The simplest case is when treatment is randomly assigned, i.e., randomized experiments.

In short, **Observed average treatment effect = Average treatment effect on the treated + selection bias**. 


## Confounding

Randomized experiments are the gold standard for causal inference. However, they are not always feasible. In observational studies, we often have selection bias, meaning that some units are more likely to receive treatments than others and thus the control group observed outcomes can provide a biased estimate of the counterfactual for the treated.

To adjust for the selection bias, we need to control for factors that are the causes of both the treatment and the outcome, which are the so-called confounders ($X$ in the causal graph).
For example, houses closer to the lake are more likely to have a higher price and also more likely to be built bigger. Or patients in worse conditions are more likely to receive treatments and also more likely to have worse outcomes.
We can control for all these confounders to adjust for the selection bias to estimate the causal effect. 

In general, we satisfy the assumption that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes given the covariates. Mathematically, this is written as $Y_{0i}, Y_{1i} \perp D | X$. There are many names for this assumption: no unmeasured confounders, conditional independence, unconfoundedness, ignorability, selection on observables etc.

Therefore, if we have the right set of controls, you can estimate the causal effect.
 The same idea is used even in structural approach, but it is well formalized in the back-door criterion. For more details on DAG, read [here]( https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/teaching/files/DAG.pdf
) and for the back-door criterion, read [here](
 https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/312992/causal-effect-by-back-door-and-front-door-adjustments).


There are other ways to estimate causal effects: difference-in-difference, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity. 

One book I recommend is Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion by Angrist and Pischke (2009). You can download it [here](http://diglib.globalcollege.edu.et:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/141/Angrist%20J.D.%2C%20Pischke%20J.-S.%20Mostly%20Harmless%20Econometrics%20%28PUP%2C%202008%29%28ISBN%20069112034X%29%28O%29%28290s%29_GL_.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

In sum, to estimate causal effects, we need to follow three steps (Heckman and Vytlacil (2007a)):

1. Define causal effects using potential outcomes
2. Identify causal effects from a hypothetical population data
3. Estimate parameters from observed samples

## Confounding control using regression

As we mention, to interpret the comparison between observed outcomes
$\mathbb{E}[Y_i | D_i = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y_i | D_i = 0]$ as causal effects, we want the selection bias as zero. With confounders, that means
$$\mathbb{E}[Y_{0i} | X_i, D_i = 1] = \mathbb{E}[Y_i | X_i, D_i = 0]$$
and it is satisfied under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders.

When we are running regression, we are exactly controlling for the confounders. 
If we are willing to assume there are no unmeasured confounders, the regression estimate for the coefficient of `bldg_1ksf` is causal effect.
Let denote `bldg_1ksf` as $D$ (treatment), other variables as $X$ (confounders), and `log_price` as $Y$ (outcome). Then

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D + \beta_2 X + \epsilon$$

```{r}
fit.all <- lm(log_price ~. , data2)    #convenient way to include all variables
summary(fit.all)
```

The regression estimate can be estimated using another way.

1. Regress `log_price` on all other variables except `bldg_1ksf`:

$$\widehat Y = \widehat \alpha_0 + \widehat \alpha X $$

2. Regress `bldg_1ksf` on all other variables to get the residuals $\widehat \eta_i$.

$$\widehat D = \widehat\gamma_0 + \widehat\gamma X $$

3. Regress the residuals of `log_price` on the residuals of `bldg_1ksf`:

$$Y - \widehat Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (D - \widehat D)   + \epsilon$$

```{r}
fit.no.land <- lm(log_price ~. -bldg_1ksf, data2)    #convenient way to include all variables
fit.land <- lm(bldg_1ksf ~ . - log_price, data2)

log_price_residual <- fit.no.land$residuals
land_sf_residual <- fit.land$residuals

fit.land_sf <- lm(log_price_residual ~ land_sf_residual)
summary(fit.land_sf)
```

We got the same estimate for $\beta_1$! This is the so-called orthogonalization process, which is intended to remove the impact of confounders $X$ on the causal variable $D$ and the outcome variable $Y$, enabling a more direct examination of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ without confounding influences. This is the idea behind the Double/Debiased Machine Learning (Chernozhukov et al., 2018).


## Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DoubleML)

 **Double/Debiased Machine Learning** (Chernozhukov et al., 2018) is a recent method to estimate causal effects. It is a generalization of the orthogonalization process. The idea is to estimate the residuals of the treatment and the outcome, and then regress the residuals of the outcome on the residuals of the treatment. The key is to use machine learning to estimate the residuals.
 
Instead of using linear model to estimate the residuals, we can be flexible:

* the outcome model:
$$Y = \beta_1 D + l(X) + \nu$$
* the treatment model:
$$D = m(X) + u$$
where $g(X)$ and $m(X)$ are flexible functions of the confounders $X$.

We can then estimate the residuals by estimating $l(X)$ and $m(X)$ using different methods, such as linear model or other methods we will introduce later in the class, then run a simple linear regression: 

$$Y - \widehat l(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ( D - \widehat m(X)) + \epsilon$$
Or in R:
$$lm(Y - \widehat Y \sim D - \widehat D)$$.

 
```{r}
pacman::p_load(DoubleML, mlr3, mlr3learners)
```

```{r}
# Specify the data and variables for the causal model
dml_data = DoubleMLData$new(data2,
                             y_col = "log_price",
                             d_cols = "bldg_1ksf",
                             x_cols = setdiff(names(data2), c("log_price", "bldg_1ksf")))
print(dml_data)
```

Let's use linear model to estimate $l(X)$ and $m(X)$.

```{r}
learner = lrn("regr.lm")
ml_l = learner$clone()
ml_m = learner$clone()
```

Then we create a DoubleML object and fit the model.

```{r}
set.seed(5)
obj_dml_plr = DoubleMLPLR$new(dml_data, ml_l = ml_l, ml_m = ml_m)
obj_dml_plr$fit()

print(obj_dml_plr)
```
We see that the estimate of $\beta_1$ is very close to the one we got from `lm()` using all the variables or using the orthogonalization process. However, the standard error is larger and thus it is not significant at 0.05 level any more. 
When fitting using DoubleML, resampling and sample splitting are happening under the hood, which could provide a better estimate to the standard deviation. We will talk about these methods later in the class as well.


Instead of linear model, we can use other methods to estimate $l(X)$ and $m(X)$ using [mlr3 package](https://mlr3learners.mlr-org.com). We show the example of using random forest to estimate $l(X)$ and $m(X)$.

```{r}
learner = lrn("regr.ranger", num.trees = 500, max.depth = 5, min.node.size = 2)
ml_l = learner$clone()
ml_m = learner$clone()

obj_dml_plr_bonus = DoubleMLPLR$new(dml_data, ml_l = ml_l, ml_m = ml_m)
obj_dml_plr_bonus$fit()

print(obj_dml_plr_bonus)
```

Using random forest, we see that the causal effect becomes larger. This could be due to the fact that random forest is more flexible and can capture the non-linear relationship between the confounders and the treatment and the outcome.
If we are happy to assume the causal assumptions, i.e., we have controlled for all the confounders, then we can conclude that the causal effect of `bldg_1ksf` on `log_price` is positive and significant.



# Summary

Summary about linear models:

   1. Linear model is simple and has nice interpretations.
   
   2. Coefficient for each predictor depends on the model. 
    
   3. LS automatically adjusts the unit of predictors.
   
   4. $t$-tests: the effect of each coeff. (Does not rank the importance of the predictors)
    
   5. $F$-tests: test a set of predictors (t-tests being special cases!)
   
   6. Model assumptions: all in residuals 
   
   7. The most damaging model violation is the presence of heteroscedasticity. It threatens the validity of each test. But we can use sandwich estimators to get the standard errors. See section Heteroscedasticity in the appendix.
   
   8. Last but not least: linear models used here only show associations between predictors and the response on average. We CANNOT conclude causality at all.


**BIGGEST QUESTION: How to identify a set of important variables or which model to use?????**

Choose models with small "prediction errors" is one way to go. We will discuss more in a seperate module  


**We could do model selection via backward eliminations**

We may eliminate the variable with the largest p-value and repeat the process to land a smaller model. We may stop either all the variables are significant at, say .1 level or we may stop at any stage.

```{r model selection}
fit.all.0 <- lm(log_price ~., data2)    #convenient way to include all variables
Anova(fit.all)
data2.1 <- data2 %>% select(-time_sale_month_of_year) # take time_sale_month_of_year out
fit.all.1 <- lm(log_price ~.,  data2.1)    
Anova(fit.all.1)
fit.all.2 <- update(fit.all.1, .~. -beds ) # refit the model taking beds out
Anova(fit.all.2)
fit.all.3 <- update(fit.all.2, .~. -rooms)
Anova(fit.all.3)
fit.all.4 <- update(fit.all.3, .~. -hbath)
Anova(fit.all.4) 
fit.final <- fit.all.4 
```
We keep `fit.all.4` as our final model. And here is the final LS analysis. We can continue to write a quick summary for the housing price analyses... Skip here. 

```{r final model}
summary(fit.final)
```


(Some interesting analyses!!!)

 What would happen if we treat `time_sale_month_of_year` as a categorical variable?  

```{r results='hide'}
names(sales)
summary(lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + time_sale_month_of_year, sales))
summary(lm(log_price ~ bldg_1ksf + as.factor(time_sale_month_of_year), sales))
```

```

## Heteroscedasticity

**Sandwich estimator**:

In a linear model, when $\text{Var}(y_i| x_i)=\sigma^2(x_i)$, i.e., the linear model is hereroscedastic. While the least squared estimator of $\beta$ is still unbiased but, the usual variance $\text{Var}( {\bf\widehat{\beta}}) \neq \sigma^2 (X^T X)^{-1}$. It has been long known among in econometrics that we can correct the variance estimator by a `Sandwich estimator`. Since
$$\text{Var}( {\bf\widehat{\beta}}) = (X^T X)^{-1}(X^T D X) (X^T X)^{-1}$$
where $D$ is a diagonal matrix of $d_i=\sigma^2_i=\text{Var}(y_i|x_i)$. We of course do not know $d_i$. So we use squared residual to estimate $d_i$: $\widehat d_i = (y_i-\widehat y_i)^2$. That yields famous Sandwich Estimator due to White (1980): 
$$\text{Var}( {\bf\widehat{\beta}}) = (X^T X)^{-1}(X^T \widehat D X) (X^T X)^{-1}$$
This correction has been implemented in various packages. We use `sandwich` with function `lmtest::coeftest(fm, df = Inf, vcov = vcovHC)`. `HC` means:Heteroscedasticity-Consistent Covariance Matrix Estimation. 

To produce a HC corrected confidence intervals for $\beta$, we first get a linear fit as  $\text{fit} = lm(y~....)$. Then apply: `lmtest::coeftest(fit, df = Inf, vcov = vcovHC)` to get the correct confidence intervals for $\beta$. 

**Remark:** Even linearity is not there, we can still fit a linear model. We can interpret the linear function as an approximation to the mean. The confidence intervals obtained using the sandwich estimators are still valid.

Let us revisit the final model with all variables:
```{r results=TRUE}
# data2 <- select(sales, log_price, bldg_1ksf:gar1_size)
fit.all <- lm(log_price ~. , data2) 
Anova(fit.all)
plot(fit.all, 1)
```
From the residual plot, one may worry the violation of linearity, as well as presence of heteroscedasticity. 

To provide a more trust-worthy analysis we may use sandwich standard errors for a more accurate inferences over coefficients.  


```{r results = TRUE}
#sandwich(fit.all)  # gives us HC cov estimator
#vcovHC(fit.all) # also gives us the HC cov matrix
fit.all.hc <- lmtest::coeftest(fit.all, df = Inf, vcov = vcovHC)
fit.all.hc  # output
```

Let compare regulare lm output and the one with sandwich cov estimation:
```{r results = "asis"}
stargazer(fit.all, fit.all.hc, type = output_format ) 
```
While the sandwich standard errors remain more or less the same as before, we do notice one difference: Asian houses are more efficient than that of American houses at $\alpha = .1$. 

The estimators for each coefficient remain the same!

```{r results = "asis"}
cov <- vcovHC(fit.all, type = "HC")
robust.se <- sqrt(diag(cov))
stargazer(fit.all, fit.all.hc, type = output_format,
          se = list(NULL, robust.se)) 
```

**Remark:** How to incoporate heteroscedasticity in prediction intervals? One easy way out is to fit another model taking residual square as response and use predicted values as the variance give $x$. We could use a more relaxed non-linear model such as trees/Random Forests. 






## Model Diagnoses via a perfect linear model

We look to fit a model containing 100 points of the equation 

$$y = 1 +2x + N(0,2) \quad i.e. \quad \beta_0 = 1 ,\beta_1 = 2, \sigma^2 = 2.$$

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

x <- runif(100)
y <- 1+2*x+rnorm(100,0, 2)
fit <- lm(y~x)
fit.perfect <- summary(lm(y~x))
rsquared <- round(fit.perfect$r.squared,2)
hat_beta_0 <- round(fit.perfect$coefficients[1], 2)
hat_beta_1 <- round(fit.perfect$coefficients[2], 2)
plot(x, y, pch=16, 
     ylim=c(-8,8),
     xlab="a perfect linear model: true mean: y=1+2x in blue, LS in red",
     main=paste("R squared= ",rsquared, 
                ", LS estimates b1=",hat_beta_1, "and b0=", hat_beta_0))
abline(fit, lwd=4, col="red")
lines(x, 1+2*x, lwd=4, col="blue")
```


Residual plot
```{r}
plot(fit$fitted, fit$residuals, pch=16,
     ylim=c(-8, 8),
     main="residual plot")
abline(h=0, lwd=4, col="red")
```




Check normality
```{r}
qqnorm(fit$residuals, ylim=c(-8, 8))
qqline(fit$residuals, lwd=4, col="blue")
```





The following example tells us we can't look at y directly to check the normality assumption. Why not? We really need to examine residuals!

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
x <- runif(1000)
y <- 1+20*x+rnorm(1000,0, 2)
plot(x, y, pch=16)
hist(y, breaks=40)
qqnorm(y, main="qqnorm for y")
qqline(y)
fit <- lm(y~x)
qqnorm(fit$residuals, main="qqnorm for residuals")
qqline(fit$residuals)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

data.frame( mean = mean(y), std.dev = sd(y))
```


## Colinearity

When some $x$'s are highly correlated we can not separate the effect. But it is still fine for the purpose of prediction.

A simulation to illustrate some consequences of colinearity. Each $p$-value for $x_1$ and $x_2$ is large but the null of both $\beta's = 0$ are rejected....  Because $x_1$ and $x_2$ are highly correlated.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
set.seed(1)  
x1 <- runif(100)
x2 <- 2*x1+rnorm(100, 0,.1)    # x1 and x2 are highly correlated
y <- 1+2*x1+rnorm(100,0, .7)   # model
newdata.cor <- cbind(y, x1,x2) # to see the strong correlations..
pairs(newdata.cor, pch=16)
```

$x_1$ is a useful predictor
```{r results=TRUE}
summary(lm(y~x1)) 
```

$x_2$ is a useful predictor
```{r results=TRUE}
summary(lm(y~x2))
```

$x_1$ and $x_2$ together show that one is not
```{r results=TRUE}
summary(lm(y~x1+x2)) 
```

Putting both highly correlated var's together we can't separate the effect of each one, though the model is still useful!
```{r results=TRUE}
data.frame(Corealation = cor(x1, x2))
```
Model dignoses show validities of model assupmtions. 
```{r}
plot(lm(y~x1+x2), 1:2)
```

##   F-distribution

A quick look at an $F$ distribution. One may change $df_1 = 4$ and $df_2=200$ to see the changes in the distribution.
```{r  eval = T}
## 

df1= 4
df2= 200
hist(rf(10000, df1, df2), freq=FALSE, breaks=200)   # pretty skewed to the right

# Fstat=(summary(fit3))$fstat    # The Fstat, df1, df2
# pvalue=1-pf(Fstat[1], 6, 219) #or pf(Fstat[1], 6, 219, lower.tail=FALSE)
# 
#  # As long as Fstat is larger than 2.14, we reject the null at .05 level.
# data.frame(F_stat = Fstat[1] , pvalue = pvalue , Cutoff = qf(.95, 6, 219))
```
